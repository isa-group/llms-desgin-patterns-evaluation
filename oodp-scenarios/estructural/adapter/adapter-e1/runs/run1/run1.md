Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. **Interface Segregation and Consistent Abstraction Levels**:
    - `Shape` and `GeometricShape` interfaces seem to represent similar concepts but are treated separately. You might want to integrate them to keep the abstraction level consistent. For example, all shapes should be able to calculate area and perimeter.

2. **Common Functionality in Base Class**:
    - The `draw()`, `resize()`, `description()`, and `isHide()` methods are common among all shapes. You can create an abstract class (e.g., `AbstractShape`) implementing `Shape` and providing default implementations of these methods. Specific shapes can extend this class.

3. **Area and Perimeter in Shape Interface**:
    - Include `area()` and `perimeter()` methods in the `Shape` interface. Every geometric shape should inherently have these properties.

4. **Use of `drawShape()`**:
    - The method `drawShape()` in `GeometricShape` is redundant if you have `draw()` in `Shape`. Consider consolidating these to have a single method for drawing.

5. **Encapsulation**:
    - The `shapes` list in the `Drawing` class should be private to follow encapsulation best practices.

6. **Use Enhanced for Loop**:
    - Instead of `shapes.stream().forEach(shape -> shape.draw())`, you can use an enhanced for loop for better readability: `for (Shape shape : shapes) { shape.draw(); }`

7. **Error Checking in Triangle and Rhombus Constructors**:
    - Add checks to ensure that the sides provided make sense (e.g., for a triangle, the sum of any two sides should be greater than the third side).

8. **Liskov Substitution Principle**:
    - Ensure that subclasses (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`) can replace their base class (`Shape`) without affecting the behavior of the program. This might involve making sure that methods behave consistently across all subclasses.

9. **Remove `Triangle` and `Rhombus` from `Main`**:
    - `Triangle` and `Rhombus` do not implement the `Shape` interface, hence they cannot be added to `Drawing` which expects `Shape` objects. Either implement `Shape` in these classes or adjust your design to accommodate these shapes.

10. **Consistent Naming**:
    - Ensure method names are consistent and clear. For example, use either `draw` or `drawShape`, but not both.

11. **Immutable Collections**:
    - If you don't want the `shapes` list in `Drawing` to be modifiable from outside, consider wrapping it in `Collections.unmodifiableList` when returning.

12. **Dependency Inversion Principle**:
    - Higher-level modules should not depend on lower-level modules but should depend on abstractions. Here, `Drawing` class is directly dependent on concrete `Shape` implementations. Consider using a factory or dependency injection for shape creation.

Here's how a part of the refactored code might look, applying some of the above suggestions:

```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
    void resize();
    String description();
    boolean isHide();
    double area();
    double perimeter();
}

public abstract class AbstractShape implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing " + this.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    // ... other default implementations ...
}

public class Circle extends AbstractShape {
    // Specific implementations for Circle
    // Override methods if Circle's behavior differs from default
}

public class Drawing {
    private final List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<>();

    // ... existing methods ...

    public void draw() {
        if (shapes.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Nothing to draw!");
        } else {
            for (Shape shape : shapes) {
                shape.draw();
            }
        }
    }
    // ... other methods ...
}
```

This is not an exhaustive list, and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and context of your project.

### USER:

I cannot modify the Shape interface

If you cannot modify the `Shape` interface, you'll need to work within the constraints of the existing interfaces and classes. Here are ways to improve the code while keeping the `Shape` interface unchanged:

1. **Integrate `GeometricShape` with `Shape` Implementation**:
    - Since you can't change the `Shape` interface, you can ensure that classes implementing `GeometricShape` also implement `Shape`, allowing them to be used interchangeably where a `Shape` is required. This can be done by having geometric shape classes implement both interfaces or by creating adapter classes.

2. **Abstract Class for Common Implementations**:
    - You can still create an abstract class that implements the `Shape` interface to provide default implementations for common methods, reducing code duplication.

3. **Adapter Pattern for `GeometricShape`**:
    - For classes like `Triangle` and `Rhombus` that implement `GeometricShape`, create adapter classes that also implement `Shape`, allowing them to be included in the `Drawing` class's list of shapes.

4. **Ensure `GeometricShape` Implementations Can Be Used as `Shape`**:
    - Modify `Triangle` and `Rhombus` (and any other `GeometricShape` implementations) to also implement the `Shape` interface, ensuring they provide implementations for all required methods.

5. **Encapsulation and Privacy**:
    - Make the `shapes` list in the `Drawing` class private to follow best encapsulation practices.

6. **Improved Looping in `Drawing`**:
    - Use enhanced for-loops for better readability when iterating over shapes to draw or resize them.

Here is an example of how you might adjust the `Triangle` and `Rhombus` classes to also implement the `Shape` interface, and an adapter pattern example:

### Adjusting `Triangle` and `Rhombus`

Ensure both `Triangle` and `Rhombus` implement the `Shape` interface. For example:

```java
public class Triangle implements Shape, GeometricShape {
    // Existing Triangle implementation...
    
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Triangle");
    }

    @Override
    public void resize() {
        System.out.println("Resizing Triangle");
    }

    @Override
    public String description() {
        return "Triangle object";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isHide() {
        return false;
    }
    
    // GeometricShape methods...
}
```

Do similarly for `Rhombus`.

### Adapter Pattern Example

If for some reason you can't directly modify `Triangle` and `Rhombus` to implement `Shape`, you could use an adapter:

```java
public class GeometricShapeAdapter implements Shape {
    private GeometricShape geometricShape;

    public GeometricShapeAdapter(GeometricShape geometricShape) {
        this.geometricShape = geometricShape;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        geometricShape.drawShape();
    }

    @Override
    public void resize() {
        // Provide a meaningful implementation or leave as no-operation if not applicable
    }

    @Override
    public String description() {
        return "GeometricShape object";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isHide() {
        return false; // Default implementation, adjust as necessary
    }
}
```

This adapter allows you to wrap a `GeometricShape` in an object that implements `Shape`, making it possible to add instances of `Triangle` and `Rhombus` to the `Drawing` class's list of shapes via the adapter.

### Evaluación y Discusión

En este caso hemos necesitado especificar la imposibilidad de modificar algunas de las interfaces originales, pero una vez establecida dicha necesidad, la identificación ha sido proaciva y exitosa.
