The code you've provided implements classes for `RoundPeg`, `RoundHole`, and `SquarePeg` and demonstrates a scenario of fitting pegs into a hole. Here are some improvements and suggestions for the code:

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
    - Currently, the `RoundHole` class has a method `fits` that accepts a `RoundPeg`. This creates a direct dependency between the two classes. To adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, consider using an interface to decouple the `fits` logic from the `RoundHole` class.

2. **Interface for Pegs:**
    - Create an interface, say `Peg`, that both `RoundPeg` and `SquarePeg` implement. This interface could have a method like `getMinRadius()` that returns the minimum radius circle in which the peg would fit. For `RoundPeg`, it's just the radius, but for `SquarePeg`, it's half of the diagonal (calculated using Pythagoras' theorem).

3. **Square Peg Adapter:**
    - To fit a square peg in a round hole, you need an adapter that converts the square peg to a round peg in terms of fitting. This is a classic example of the Adapter pattern. The `fits` method in `RoundHole` should then only need to know about the `Peg` interface.

4. **Error Handling and Validation:**
    - Add input validation for the constructors. For instance, a peg or hole with a negative radius doesn't make sense.

5. **Code Readability:**
    - Remove unnecessary local variables where they are not needed for clarity. For example, in `getSquare` method in `SquarePeg`, you can return the calculation directly.

6. **Proper Naming:**
    - The method `getSquare` in `SquarePeg` is a bit misleading. It seems to calculate the area, but it's actually used to get the square of the width. Consider renaming it to reflect its purpose or adjusting its functionality.

7. **Final Variables:**
    - If the dimensions of the pegs or holes are not supposed to change, consider marking the radius/width fields as `final` to ensure immutability.

8. **Demonstration Logic:**
    - In the `main` method, the checks for square pegs fitting into round holes will not compile because `fits` method does not accept `SquarePeg`. This should be resolved with the Adapter pattern mentioned earlier.

Here's a basic restructuring of your code to incorporate some of these improvements (specifically points 1, 2, and 3):

```java
public interface Peg {
    double getMinRadius();
}

public class RoundPeg implements Peg {
    private final double radius;

    public RoundPeg(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double getMinRadius() {
        return getRadius();
    }
}

public class SquarePegAdapter implements Peg {
    private final SquarePeg peg;

    public SquarePegAdapter(SquarePeg peg) {
        this.peg = peg;
    }

    @Override
    public double getMinRadius() {
        // Calculate the minimum radius circle that fits the square peg
        return peg.getWidth() * Math.sqrt(2) / 2;
    }
}

public class SquarePeg {
    private final double width;

    public SquarePeg(double width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

    public double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }
}

public class RoundHole {
    private final double radius;

    public RoundHole(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    public boolean fits(Peg peg) {
        return this.getRadius() >= peg.getMinRadius();
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // similar main method, but use SquarePegAdapter for square pegs
    }
}
```
This structure improves the design by introducing an interface `Peg` and an adapter `SquarePegAdapter` to handle the compatibility between square pegs and round holes.
